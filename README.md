## Atom, who :question: 
Atom is a teletype that makes collaborating on code just as easy as it is to code alone, right from your editor.  
You can share your workspace and edit codes together in real time.

> *" Great things happen when developers work together—from teaching and sharing knowledge to building better software. "*

## Why we should use Atom :question:

Pro's | Contra's 
--- | --- 
 Cross-platform editing | It’s slow compared to Sublime Text.
Smart autocompletion | It can't handle a lot of large files. 
Multiple panes | atom browser features like thousands of small files.

###### Pro's explaining:
1. Atom works across **operating systems.** Use it on OS X, Windows, or Linux.
2. Atom helps you write code faster with a smart and **flexible autocomplete.**
3. **Split** your Atom interface into multiple panes to compare and edit code across files.

###### Contra's explainig:

- [ ]  It takes a bit before Atom open's.
- [ ]  It can be that Atom freezes sometimes when u got a large file. 
- [ ]  That means that syncing takes a good couple minutes before it gonna work. 

## Why did I choose for Atom :question:

* It's FREE  
* You got shortcuts so it makes it easier to code something
* Nice design, active package (extension) community.
