## Atom, who :question: 
Atom is a teletype that makes collaborating on code just as easy as it is to code alone, right from your editor.  
You can share your workspace and edit codes together in real time.

> *" Great things happen when developers work togetherâ€”from teaching and sharing knowledge to building better software. "*

## Why we should use Atom :question:

Pro's | Contra's 
--- | --- 
 Cross-platform editing|  
Smart autocompletion | 
Multiple panes | 

###### Pro's explaining:
1. Atom works across operating systems. Use it on OS X, Windows, or Linux.
2. Atom helps you write code faster with a smart and flexible autocomplete.
3. Split your Atom interface into multiple panes to compare and edit code across files.

###### Contra's explainig:

- [ ]  If u want to make a own private pen u need to pay for a pro version of CodePen otherwise its always public.
- [ ]  In the free version of CodePen are the best tools not available.
- [ ]  You can't go back in your history about wich codes u used in your project after you closed it. You only can ctrl + z.

## Why did I choose for Atom :question:

* I used CodePen in my first year of my bachelor degree and I enjoyed it using it. 
* It's user friendly, it got structure and its not difficult to use. 
* Also is it verry handy that you immediately see what your code is doing or what it is not doing.
